concept++
-in the process of putting things from ModRPG in here that wouldn't go with that era in another setting (WesSaga)
-changed the up stairs to new spiral stair graphic, switched down stairs graphic to trapdoor-open
-made it so you start at the down exit if you just went up
-floors will now randomly put terrain down, most terrain will be regular, others put in for variety
-altered mobs: separated mob "factions" into respective sides that aren't allied with each other, 2 main factions will spawn on opposite sides of the map, random of other factions will spawn all over, slightly tweeked how mob units are chosen
-added lvl0s units to recruit from tavern
-added new mudcrawler-type enemies
-added well terrain which heals/cures
-added "level cleared", if you clear a level of enemies you will skip it after that, but only if you clear the levels in order
-fixed shops not working, there's a bug in wesnoth with menu_items https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?12946 if that's ever fixed, I can go back to the old way of doing things
